    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        You've spent time creating content, optimizing your pages, and maybe even invested in a few tools. But your website still isn't showing up where you want it to on Google. Frustrating, right?
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The truth is, many websites struggle with ranking not because they aren't trying, but because they're unknowingly making mistakes that hold them back. And the worst part? These mistakes are often simple to fix if you know what to look for.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In this post, we're going to walk through some of the most common SEO mistakes that quietly hurt your visibility and what you can do to fix them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Ignoring Search Intent</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Search intent is the reason behind a user's search. Are they looking for information? Trying to buy something? Comparing options?
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If your content does not match what people are actually looking for, Google will skip right over you. For example, if someone searches for "best running shoes for beginners," and your page just lists your own product with no comparisons or helpful advice, it's not going to rank well.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-blue-800">
            Make sure every piece of content you create matches the user's intent – informational, navigational, commercial, or transactional. Look at the top ranking pages for your target keyword and study what they are doing.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Keyword Stuffing</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Yes, keywords are important. But jamming your main keyword into every sentence is a quick way to get flagged by search engines and annoy your readers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google has gotten much better at understanding natural language. It wants your content to sound like a human wrote it — because that's who it's for.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-green-800">
            Use your primary keyword a few times in natural places like your title, introduction, and subheadings. Then sprinkle in related terms and phrases your audience might use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Slow Page Speed</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google does not want to send users to slow websites. And let's be honest — neither do your visitors. A slow loading page creates a poor experience, increases bounce rates, and kills your SEO potential.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-orange-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-orange-800">
            Compress images, use proper hosting, minimize unnecessary plugins, and consider using a content delivery network. Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights can tell you exactly what's slowing your site down.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Poor Mobile Experience</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        More than half of web traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site looks great on desktop but is clunky or unreadable on a phone, it will cost you rankings.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google now uses mobile-first indexing. That means it evaluates your mobile site as the primary version, not your desktop one.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-purple-800">
            Use responsive design, test your site on different devices, and make sure buttons, text, and menus are easy to use on small screens.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Missing or Weak Title Tags and Meta Descriptions</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Your title tag is often the first thing someone sees in search results. If it's generic, too long, or missing your keyword, you're missing a major ranking opportunity.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Meta descriptions may not directly affect rankings, but they influence click-through rates. A weak one can mean fewer people clicking on your content even if you rank.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-teal-50 border border-teal-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-teal-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-teal-800">
            Write clear, concise titles that include your target keyword. For meta descriptions, write compelling summaries that encourage people to click, even if they're just scanning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Not Using Internal Links</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Internal linking helps Google understand the structure of your site and the relationship between pages. It also keeps users on your site longer, which is good for SEO.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If you don't link between relevant content, you're leaving both ranking power and user engagement on the table.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-indigo-50 border border-indigo-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-indigo-800">
            Every time you publish a new post or page, link to related articles or services you've already created. And go back to older posts to link forward to newer ones.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Thin or Duplicate Content</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google favors content that's helpful, unique, and in-depth. Pages with just a few sentences, or content copied from elsewhere, are unlikely to perform well.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-red-800">
            Focus on creating original, well researched content that genuinely answers questions your audience is asking. If you need to write about similar topics, give each piece a unique angle or purpose.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">8. Forgetting About Technical SEO</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Even if your content is great, technical issues can stop search engines from crawling and indexing your site properly. Things like broken links, missing XML sitemaps, or incorrect use of no index tags can all hurt your rankings.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-3">Fix it:</h4>
        <p class="text-yellow-800">
            Use tools like Google Search Console or Screaming Frog to run a technical audit. Fix broken links, submit a sitemap, and make sure your site is crawlable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        SEO is not just about doing the right things – it's also about avoiding the wrong ones. The good news is that most common mistakes are fixable. You don't need to be an expert to make real improvements.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Start by focusing on your users. Deliver content they actually want, make sure your site is fast and mobile friendly, and clean up any technical issues that might be holding you back. Small steps can make a big difference.

        <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. How can I find out if my site has SEO issues?</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                You can use tools like Google Search Console, Ahrefs, SEMrush, or even free ones like Ubersuggest to scan your site for problems.

            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Do I need to hire an SEO expert to fix these mistakes?</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Not necessarily. Many basic SEO fixes can be done on your own, especially with tutorials and guides. But if you're dealing with technical issues or need a full strategy, bringing in help can be a smart move.

            <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. How long does it take to see SEO improvements after fixing mistakes?</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                It depends on the issue and how competitive your niche is. Some changes, like improving page speed or fixing a title tag, can help in a few weeks. Others take months to show results.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Ignoring your audience. SEO is not just about search engines — it's about people. If your content does not solve a real problem or meet a real need, rankings will suffer.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                SEO is ongoing. Search engines change, competitors update their content, and your audience's needs evolve. Regular maintenance and updates are part of a strong long term strategy.
