    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Marketing in 2025 isn't about gut feelings or guessing what works anymore. It's about data – knowing what your audience wants, 
        how they behave, and which strategies actually drive results. This is where analytics comes in. Think of it as your marketing 
        compass – it points you in the right direction, highlights opportunities, and helps you avoid costly mistakes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Analytics Matters</h3>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Imagine you're running a campaign on social media. You post content, boost some ads, and… nothing seems to move. Your engagement 
        is low, and your sales aren't increasing. Without analytics, you're left wondering:
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <ul class="text-red-800 space-y-2">
            <li class="flex items-center"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-red-500 mr-2"></i> "What went wrong? Was it the content?"</li>
            <li class="flex items-center"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-red-500 mr-2"></i> "Was it the audience?"</li>
            <li class="flex items-center"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-red-500 mr-2"></i> "Was it the timing?"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Analytics gives you answers. By looking at metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement patterns, 
        you know exactly what's working and what isn't. It turns marketing from guesswork into a science – helping you spend less, 
        achieve more, and grow smarter.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Areas Where Analytics Drives Smarter Decisions</h3>
    
    <div class="space-y-6 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">1. Understanding Your Audience</h4>
            <p class="text-blue-800 mb-3">
                Analytics tells you who your audience really is – their age, location, interests, and online behavior.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-4">
                <p class="text-gray-700 italic">
                    For example, you might discover that most of your website traffic comes from users aged 25–34 on mobile devices. 
                    Knowing this, you can create content and campaigns that resonate with that audience, rather than targeting everyone blindly.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-3">2. Optimizing Campaign Performance</h4>
            <p class="text-green-800 mb-3">
                Every marketing campaign has multiple moving parts – ads, emails, social posts, landing pages. Analytics shows you 
                which elements are performing and which aren't.
            </p>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-4 text-center">
                    <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer text-green-500 text-2xl mb-2"></i>
                    <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">Which ad gets the highest clicks?</p>

            <p class="text-purple-800 mb-3">
                Running campaigns without knowing the return on investment (ROI) is like pouring water into a leaky bucket.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-4 mb-3">
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                    Analytics lets you track revenue generated from every marketing effort – whether it's paid ads, social campaigns, 
                    or content marketing. You can calculate:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 text-center">
                    <code class="text-purple-600 font-mono text-lg">
                        ROI = (Revenue from Campaign – Campaign Cost) ÷ Campaign Cost × 100

                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-purple-800">
                This ensures you're investing in strategies that truly deliver results, rather than wasting budget.

            <p class="text-orange-800 mb-3">
                Analytics isn't just about looking back – it helps you predict the future. By studying patterns and trends, 
                you can anticipate customer behavior:
